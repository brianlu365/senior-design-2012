Draw Lines with hand movement.
Lines can not exceed a length of 200.
Whenever a line exceed a length of 200, current line will be discarded and a new line will be construted.
Lines are implemented by linked list, in which each node stores a point along the line.
The distance between each node is strictly 1.
